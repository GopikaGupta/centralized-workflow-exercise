# Mushroom soup recipe


## Ingredients

- Rapeseed oil (or butter for taste)
- 1 onion, chopped
- 400g reindeer (thinly sliced)
- water (about 4 cups in total)
- 1 stock cube / pot (game or beef)
- 6-7 potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 2-3 carrots, cleaned and cubed
- Salt
- Black pepper
- 150 g smoked reindeer cheese (or Philadelphia cheese)
- Sour cream (optional - I added a couple of tablespoons)
- 2 tbsp fresh flat leaf parsley - chopped


## Instructions

1. **Prepare:**
   - Heat the oil in a frying pan and saute the chopped onion. 
   - Add the thinly sliced meat and brown lightly. 
   - Pull the meat apart while frying, so you end up with very small pieces.

2. **Pour:**
   - Pour the meat and onion mix into a deep sauce pan, add enough water to cover. 
   - Add the stock pot, salt and pepper. 
   - Bring to boil and let simmer until meat is really tender, around 30-45 minutes.

3. **Add Potatoes:**
   - Add the potatoes and carrots and enough water to cover the ingredients. 
   - Cook until the vegetables are done, about 15 min.

4. **Add the Cheese:**
   - Add the cheese and sour cream if using. 
   - Mix well until the cheese has melted. 
   - Check seasoning and sprinkle with the parsley.

5. **Serve:**
   - Serve with toasted dark rye bread and butter.
