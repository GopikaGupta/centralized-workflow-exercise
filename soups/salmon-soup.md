Salmon soup 

Ingredients:

½ stick (¼ cup or about 50 grams) unsalted butter
1 leek, sliced (white and light green parts only)
5 cups (1,25l) fish stock (can be substituted with water)
1 lb (450g) potatoes, cubed
1 carrot, sliced
1 lb (450g) salmon fillet, de-boned, de-skinned and cut into small chunks
1 cup (250ml) heavy cream
1 cup (10g) fresh dill for garnish, finely chopped
salt and pepper to taste


Instructions:

Melt the butter in a pot. Add the sliced leek and saute until translucent, about 7 minutes.
Add the stock, carrot and potatoes. Bring to a boil and cook for about 10 minutes over medium heat. At this point the potatoes should be almost ready.
Add the salmon chunks and the cream, and cook for about 5-7 minutes more, until it starts to boil.
Turn off the heat and add the dill, salt and pepper. Close the lid and wait for another 10 minutes. Enjoy!
