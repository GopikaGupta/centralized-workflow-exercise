# Gazpacho

## Ingredients

- Tomatoes. About 2 pounds of ripe tomatoes
- Cucumber. 
- Green bell pepper
- Onion. 
- Celery. Celery is not traditionally used in this soup, so it is optional
- 2 garlic cloves
- Bread. Use stale white bread and trim the crust off. The bread is typically soaked in water until ver soft, then squeezed well to dispose of excess water. 
- Extra Virgin Olive Oil
- Sherry vinegar. 
- Seasoning. You can certainly stick only to salt, pepper
- Herbs for garnish. I like to use a little mint and cilantro, again this is a personal preference.


## Instructions

- Blanch and peel the tomatoes
- Puree
- Chill
